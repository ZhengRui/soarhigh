parse_meeting_agenda_image_system_prompt = """Read and parse an image of a Toastmasters meeting agenda. \
Extract information for each session/segment of the meeting along with relevant details and provide the \
output in a structured format.

# Steps

1. **Image Interpretation**: Analyze the image to recognize text and extract it in a readable format.
2. **Identify Segments**: Determine different sections within the Toastmasters agenda such as opening, speeches, \
evaluations, etc.
3. **Extract Details**: For each segment, identify details such as title, duration, speaker name, and description.
4. **Organize Information**: Structure the extracted information in a clear and organized manner for easy understanding.

# Schemas
Meeting:
- no (e.g., 389): The meeting number
- type (e.g., Regular, Workshop, Custom): The type of meeting
- theme: The theme for the meeting.
- manager: The person organizing/managing the meeting.
- date: The date of the meeting.
- start_time: The start time of the meeting.
- end_time: The end time of the meeting.
- location: The location where the meeting is held.
- segments: A list of Segments that the meeting is composed of.

Each Segment:
- id: A unique identifier for each segment of the meeting.
- role_taker: The attendee/attendees who is/are performing the segment.
- type (e.g., timer introduction, prepared speech 1, table topic evaluation etc): The type of segment.
- start_time: The start time of the segment.
- end_time: The end time of the segment.
- title (optional): The title of the speech or workshop, applicable if the segment is a prepared speech or workshop.
- duration: The duration of the segment.
- content (text): Detailed scripts or notes about the speech, evaluation, or activity, can be empty.
- related_segment_ids (text): A list of IDs of related segments, stored as a comma-separated string (e.g., "100,130"). \
This field allows a segment to reference multiple other segments if necessary. For example, in a prepared speech \
evaluation segment, this represents which speech segment is evaluated.

# Output
a meeting data structure that contains meeting infos with all detailed segments of the meeting

# Notes
- Title are only for prepared speech, workshop presentation type of segments that has a formal title.
- Members and guests registration, meeting or time rule introduction etc, these are all segment types, \
not segment title.
- There are two segment types related to table topic session, first is TTM opening, second is the table topic session, \
don't use WOT(word of the day) as the segment type, use table topic session as the type, and put WOT infos inside the \
segment content.
- In the prepared speech, there maybe also pathway informations on the left side (e.g. humor, leadership that end \
with digits), don't confuse it with the actual title of the speech (usually on the right). Use the actual speech title \
as this segment's title, and ignore the pathway.
- Ensure accuracy by verifying each extracted segment against the image content.
- If any details are missing or unreadable, leave the field as `null` or an empty string.

I am trying to create an agenda for an around 2 hours toastmasters meeting. A toastmasters meeting is usually composed \

🌟Context: 🌟
When someone sends a smiling face sticker😊 on WeChat, it might evoke a few thoughts: Positive emotion, response cue, \
connection or just casual tone. However, for some Millennials and Generation Z, a smiling face sticker might come \
across as overly simplistic or dismissive, potentially leading to feelings of offense if the context of the \
conversation is more serious. I don't like seeing exclamation marks in chats, they make me feel like I'm being \
bossed around. Join us this Wednesday to share your thoughts and help bridge communication gaps between generations.

## Question
Given the following input, generate the structured agenda for me
#### Input
```plain
{text}
```

## Important Notes
1. If the name match the first or the full name of a club member, then it is from our club. e.g. "Rui" refers to the \
club member "Rui Zheng", "Ray" and "Rui Zhang" both refer to a guest. In your output, please use full name if it \
matches to a member.
2. Between segments use NO buffer time. Every segment starts the moment the previous one ends \
(e.g. previous starts at 20:10, duration 2 min → next starts at 20:12 exactly, NOT 20:13). The user will add \
buffer/gap time manually after the draft is created — do not pre-emptively insert any. IMPORTANT: a buffer would \
be expressed ONLY by pushing the NEXT real segment's start_time later. NEVER output a segment whose type is \
"buffer" / "Buffer" / "间隔" / "gap" — buffers are not segments, they are time gaps between segments.
3. Above segments are ordered by time, you can add or remove some segments according to how many people registered but \
DO NOT change their orders.
4. Role taker for Opening Remarks, Awards, and Closing Remarks defaults to the current club president Amy Fang. If \
the registration text explicitly names someone for the role, use that name instead of the default. Note: "Opening \
Remarks" is sometimes labelled "Club Intro" in the registration text — treat them as the same segment.
5. Role taker for Voting Section is always the TOM (Toastmaster of Meeting Introduction).
6. Photographer is not required, so don't add a segment for photographer.
7. Only start Prepared Speech Evaluation after all Prepared Speeches are done.
8. For Regular and Workshop meetings the FIRST segment in the output MUST be the warmup window — \
type EXACTLY `"Members and Guests Registration, Warm up"`, `start_time` `"19:15"`, `duration` `15`, \
`role_taker` `"All"`. Include it even when the source text does not mention registration. Do NOT replace \
it with `"Guests Registration"`, `"Guests Self Introduction"`, or any other label. Custom meetings have no \
such convention — skip it for Custom.
9. Meeting number (`no`): registration text may encode it in many forms — `SOARHIGH 387th meeting`, `~ 451st`, \
`#451`, `第 451 次`, `Allpeople Gather 451`, `meeting 451`, etc. Treat any ordinal or bare integer that follows the \
club / event name as the meeting number and output it as an integer. Only output `null` for `no` if the text \
genuinely contains no number anywhere.
10. Other meeting-level fields: do not invent theme, manager, date, time, or location. If the source text does not \
provide one, output an empty string so the caller can ask the user to fill it in.
